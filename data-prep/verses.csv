Upanishads+Katha-1-1,Upanishads,1,1,"Vahasrava, being desirous of heavenly rewards (at the Viswajit sacrifice), made a gift of all that he possessed. He had a son by the name of Nachiketas."

Upanishads+Katha-1-3,Upanishads,1,3,"These cows have drunk water, eaten grass and given milk for the last time, and their senses have lost all vigour. He who gives these undoubtedly goes to joyless realms."
Upanishads+Katha-1-4,Upanishads,1,4,"He said to his father: Dear father, to whom wilt thou give me? He said it a second time, then a third time. The father replied: I shall give thee unto Death."
Upanishads+Katha-1-5,Upanishads,1,5,Nachiketas thought: Among many (of my father's pupils) I stand first; among many (others) I stand in the middle (but never last). What will be accomplished for my father by my going this day to Yama?
Upanishads+Katha-1-6,Upanishads,1,6,Look back to those who lived before and look to those who live now. Like grain the mortal decays and like grain again springs up (is reborn).

Upanishads+Katha-1-10,Upanishads,1,10,"Nachiketas said: May Gautama, my father, be free from anxious thought (about me). May he lose all anger (towards me) and be pacified in heart. May he know and welcome me when I am sent back by thee. This, O Death, is the first of the three boons I choose."
Upanishads+Katha-1-11,Upanishads,1,11,"Yama replied: Through my will Auddalaki Aruni (thy father) will know thee, and be again towards thee as before. He will sleep in peace at night. He will be free from wrath when he sees thee released from the mouth of death."
Upanishads+Katha-1-12,Upanishads,1,12,"Nachiketas said: In the realm of heaven there is no fear, thou (Death) art not there; nor is there fear of old age. Having crossed beyond both hunger and thirst and being above grief, (they) rejoice in heaven."
Upanishads+Katha-1-13,Upanishads,1,13,"Thou knowest, O Death, the fire-sacrifice that leads to heaven. Tell this to me, who am full of Shraddha (faith and yearning). They who live in the realm of heaven enjoy freedom from death. This I beg as my second boon."
Upanishads+Katha-1-14,Upanishads,1,14,"Yama replied: I know well that fire which leads to the realm of heaven. I shall tell it to thee. Listen to me. Know, O Nachiketas, that this is the means of attaining endless worlds and their support. It is hidden in the heart of all beings."
Upanishads+Katha-1-15,Upanishads,1,15,"Yama then told him that fire-sacrifice, the beginning of all the worlds; what bricks, how many and how laid for the altar. Nachiketas repeated all as it was told to him. Then Death, being pleased with him, again said:"
Upanishads+Katha-1-16,Upanishads,1,16,"The great-soured Yama, being well pleased, said to him (Nachiketas): I give thee now another boon. This fire (sacrifice) shall be named after thee. Take also this garland of many colours."
Upanishads+Katha-1-17,Upanishads,1,17,"He who performs this Nachiketa fire-sacrifice three times, being united with the three (mother, father and teacher), and who fulfills the three-fold duty (study of the Vedas, sacrifice and alms-giving) crosses over birth and death. Knowing this worshipful shining fire, born of Brahman, and realizing Him, he attains eternal peace."
Upanishads+Katha-1-18,Upanishads,1,18,"He who knows the three-fold Nachiketa fire and performs the Nachiketa fire-sacrifice with three-fold knowledge, having cast off the fetters of death and being beyond grief, he rejoices in the realm of heaven."
Upanishads+Katha-1-19,Upanishads,1,19,"O Nachiketas, this is thy fire that leads to heaven, which thou hast chosen as thy second boon. People will call this fire after thy name. Ask the third boon, Nachiketas."
Upanishads+Katha-1-20,Upanishads,1,20,"Nachiketas said: There is this doubt regarding what becomes of a man after death. Some say he exists, others that he does not exist. This knowledge I desire, being instructed by thee. Of the boons this is the third boon."
Upanishads+Katha-1-21,Upanishads,1,21,"Yama replied: Even the Devas (Bright Ones) of old doubted regarding this. It is not easy to know; subtle indeed is this subject. O Nachiketas, choose another boon. Do not press me. Ask not this boon of me."
Upanishads+Katha-1-22,Upanishads,1,22,"Nachiketas said: O Death, thou sayest that even the Devas had doubts about this, and that it is not easy to know. Another teacher like unto thee is not to be found. Therefore no other boon can be equal to this one."
Upanishads+Katha-1-23,Upanishads,1,23,"Yama said: Ask for sons and grandsons who shall live a hundred years, many cattle, elephants, gold and horses. Ask for lands of vast extent and live thyself as many autumns as thou desirest."
Upanishads+Katha-1-24,Upanishads,1,24,"If thou thinkest of any other boon equal to this, ask for wealth and long life; be ruler over the wide earth. O Nachiketas, I shall make thee enjoyer of all desires."
Upanishads+Katha-1-25,Upanishads,1,25,"Whatsoever objects of desire are difficult to obtain in the realm of mortals, ask them all as thou desirest; these lovely maidens with their chariots and musical instruments, such as are not obtainable by mortals--be served by these whom I give to thee. O Nachiketas, do not ask regarding death."
Upanishads+Katha-1-26,Upanishads,1,26,"Nachiketas said: O Death, these are fleeting; they weaken the vigour of all the senses in man. Even the longest life is short. Keep thou thy chariots, dance and music."
Upanishads+Katha-1-27,Upanishads,1,27,Man cannot be satisfied by wealth. Shall we possess wealth when we see thee (Death)? Shall we continue to live as long as thou rulest? Therefore that boon alone is to be chosen by me.
Upanishads+Katha-1-28,Upanishads,1,28,"What man dwelling on the decaying mortal plane, having approached the undecaying immortal one, and having reflected upon the nature of enjoyment through beauty and sense pleasure, would delight in long life?"
Upanishads+Katha-1-29,Upanishads,1,29,"O Death, that regarding which there is doubt, of the great Hereafter, tell us. Nachiketas asks for no other boon than that which penetrates this hidden secret."
Upanishads+Katha-2-1,Upanishads,2,1,"Yama said: The good is one thing and the pleasant another. These two, having different ends, bind a man. It is well with him who chooses the good. He who chooses the pleasant misses the true end."
Upanishads+Katha-2-2,Upanishads,2,2,"The good and the pleasant approach man; the wise examines both and discriminates between them; the wise prefers the good to the pleasant, but the foolish man chooses the pleasant through love of bodily pleasure."
Upanishads+Katha-2-3,Upanishads,2,3,O Nachiketas after wise reflection thou hast renounced the pleasant and all pleasing forms. Thou hast not accepted this garland of great value for which many mortals perish.
Upanishads+Katha-2-4,Upanishads,2,4,"Wide apart are these two,--ignorance and what is known as wisdom, leading in opposite directions. I believe Nachiketas to be one who longs for wisdom, since many tempting objects have not turned thee aside."
Upanishads+Katha-2-5,Upanishads,2,5,"Fools dwelling in ignorance, yet imagining themselves wise and learned, go round and round in crooked ways, like the blind led by the blind."
Upanishads+Katha-2-6,Upanishads,2,6,"The Hereafter never rises before the thoughtless child (the ignorant), deluded by the glamour of wealth. ""This world alone is, there is none other"": thinking thus, he falls under my sway again and again."
Upanishads+Katha-2-7,Upanishads,2,7,"He about whom many are not even able to hear, whom many cannot comprehend even after hearing: wonderful is the teacher, wonderful is he who can receive when taught by an able teacher."
Upanishads+Katha-2-8,Upanishads,2,8,"When taught by a man of inferior understanding, this Atman cannot be truly known, even though frequently thought upon. There is no way (to know It) unless it is taught by another (an illumined teacher), for it is subtler than the subtle and beyond argument."
Upanishads+Katha-2-9,Upanishads,2,9,"O Dearest, this Atman cannot be attained by argument; It is truly known only when taught by another (a wise teacher). O Nachiketas, thou hast attained It. Thou art fixed in Truth. May we ever, find a questioner like thee."
Upanishads+Katha-2-10,Upanishads,2,10,"I know that (earthly) treasure is transitory, for the eternal can never be attained by things which are non-eternal. Hence the Nachiketa fire (sacrifice) has been performed by me with perishable things and yet I have attained the eternal."
Upanishads+Katha-2-11,Upanishads,2,11,"O Nachiketas, thou hast seen the fulfillment of all desires, the basis of the universe, the endless fruit of sacrificial rites, the other shore where there is no fear, that which is praiseworthy, the great and wide support; yet, being wise, thou hast rejected all with firm resolve."
Upanishads+Katha-2-12,Upanishads,2,12,"The wise, who by means of the highest meditation on the Self knows the Ancient One, difficult to perceive, seated in the innermost recess, hidden in the cave of the heart, dwelling in the depth of inner being, (he who knows that One) as God, is liberated from the fetters of joy and sorrow."
Upanishads+Katha-2-13,Upanishads,2,13,"A mortal, having heard and fully grasped this, and having realized through discrimination the subtle Self, rejoices, because he has obtained that which is the source of all joy. I think the abode (of Truth) is open to Nachiketas."
Upanishads+Katha-2-14,Upanishads,2,14,"Nachiketas said: That which thou seest, which is neither virtue nor vice, neither cause nor effect, neither past nor future (but beyond these), tell me That."
Upanishads+Katha-2-15,Upanishads,2,15,"Yama replied: That goal which all the Vedas glorify, which all austerities proclaim, desiring which (people) practice Brahmacharya (a life of continence and service), that goal I tell thee briefly--it is Aum."
Upanishads+Katha-2-16,Upanishads,2,16,This Word is indeed Brahman. This Word is indeed the Supreme. He who knows this Word obtains whatever he desires.
Upanishads+Katha-2-17,Upanishads,2,17,"This is the best Support, This is the highest Support; he who knows this Support is glorified in the world of Brahman."
Upanishads+Katha-2-18,Upanishads,2,18,"This Self is never born, nor does It die. It did not spring from anything, nor did anything spring from It. This Ancient One is unborn, eternal, everlasting. It is not slain even though the body is slain."
Upanishads+Katha-2-19,Upanishads,2,19,"If the slayer thinks that he slays, or if the slain thinks that he is slain, both of these know not. For It neither slays nor is It slain."
Upanishads+Katha-2-20,Upanishads,2,20,"The Self is subtler than the subtle, greater than the great; It dwells in the heart of each living being. He who is free from desire and free from grief, with mind and senses tranquil, beholds the glory of the Atman."
Upanishads+Katha-2-21,Upanishads,2,21,"Though sitting, It travels far; though lying, It goes everywhere. Who else save me is fit to know that God, who is (both) joyful and joyless?"
Upanishads+Katha-2-22,Upanishads,2,22,"The wise who know the Self, bodiless, seated within perishable bodies, great and all- pervading, grieve not."
Upanishads+Katha-2-23,Upanishads,2,23,"This Self cannot be attained by study of the Scriptures, nor by intellectual perception, nor by frequent hearing (of It); He whom the Self chooses, by him alone is It attained. To him the Self reveals Its true nature."
Upanishads+Katha-2-24,Upanishads,2,24,"He who has not turned away from evil conduct, whose senses are uncontrolled, who is not tranquil, whose mind is not at rest, he can never attain this Atman even by knowledge."
Upanishads+Katha-2-25,Upanishads,2,25,Who then can know where is this mighty Self? He (that Self) to whom the Brahmanas and Kshatriyas are but food and death itself a condiment.
Upanishads+Katha-3-1,Upanishads,3,1,"There are two who enjoy the fruits of their good deeds in the world, having entered into the cave of the heart, seated (there) on the highest summit. The knowers of Brahman call them shadow and light. So also (they are called) by householders who perform five fire- sacrifices or three Nachiketa fire-sacrifices."
Upanishads+Katha-3-2,Upanishads,3,2,"May we be able to learn that Nachiketa fire-sacrifice, which is a bridge for those who perform sacrifice. May we also know the One, who is the highest imperishable Brahman for those who desire to cross over to the other shore which is beyond fear."
Upanishads+Katha-3-3,Upanishads,3,3,"Know the Atman (Self) as the lord of the chariot, and the body as the chariot. Know also the intellect to be the driver and mind the reins."
Upanishads+Katha-3-4,Upanishads,3,4,"The senses are called the horses; the sense objects are the roads; when the Atman is united with body, senses and mind, then the wise call Him the enjoyer."
Upanishads+Katha-3-5,Upanishads,3,5,"He who is without discrimination and whose mind is always uncontrolled, his senses are unmanageable, like the vicious horses of a driver."

Upanishads+Katha-3-9,Upanishads,3,9,"The man who has a discriminative intellect for the driver, and a controlled mind for the reins, reaches the end of the journey, the highest place of Vishnu (the All-pervading and Unchangeable One)."

Upanishads+Katha-3-11,Upanishads,3,11,"Beyond the great Atman is the Unmanifested; beyond the Unmanifested is the Purusha (the Cosmic Soul); beyond the Purusha there is nothing. That is the end, that is the final goal."
Upanishads+Katha-3-12,Upanishads,3,12,"This Atman (Self), hidden in all beings, does not shine forth; but It is seen by subtle seers through keen and subtle understanding."

Upanishads+Katha-3-14,Upanishads,3,14,"Arise! Awake! Having reached the Great Ones (illumined Teachers), gain understanding. The path is as sharp as a razor, impassable and difficult to travel, so the wise declare."
Upanishads+Katha-3-15,Upanishads,3,15,"Knowing That which is soundless, touchless, formless, undecaying; also tasteless, odorless, and eternal; beginningless, endless and immutable; beyond the Unmanifested: (knowing That) man escapes from the mouth of death."
Upanishads+Katha-3-16,Upanishads,3,16,"The intelligent man, who has heard and repeated the ancient story of Nachiketas, told by the Ruler of Death, is glorified in the world of Brahman."

Upanishads+Katha-4-1,Upanishads,4,1,"The Self-existent created the senses out-going; for this reason man sees the external, but not the inner Atman (Self). Some wise man, however, desiring immortality, with eyes turned away (from the external) sees the Atman within."
Upanishads+Katha-4-2,Upanishads,4,2,"Children (the ignorant) pursue external pleasures; (thus) they fall into the wide- spread snare of death. But the wise, knowing the nature of immortality, do not seek the permanent among fleeting things."

Upanishads+Katha-5-2,Upanishads,5,2,"He is the sun dwelling in the bright heaven; He is the air dwelling in space; He is the fire burning on the altar; He is the guest dwelling in the house.

Upanishads+Katha-5-9,Upanishads,5,9,"As fire, though one, having entered the world, becomes various according to what it burns, so does the Atman (Self) within all living beings, though one, become various according to what it enters. It also exists outside."
